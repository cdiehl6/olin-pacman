In our pacman project, there are a few things tht could be improved within our gameplay to make the gameplay more like that in the original pacman game. The things that could be improved fall into three categories: the pacman, the ghosts, and the general map or background things.

As far as pacman is concerned, we have it set that pacman's center pixel can be in any legal position on the board. This means that as lotg as pacman's center pixel is in a legal position, the rest of pacman doe not have to be. This allows pacman to move back and forth within the tunnels. In the original pacman game, pacman's center pixel must be on the center pixel of the tunnel, so he cannot move back and forth within the tunnel. Another thing that should be fixed is that the turning is really difficult. Because of the way our corner tiles look, and that the corners for the corner tiles are in the middle of the tiles, it looks like you can turn about half a tile before you are actually able to turn. This makes it very difficult to judge when to turn to get into the various, harder to reach parts of the maze. 

For the ghosts, the main problem is that they get stuck in the house some times. This happens when pacman is in the bottom half of the maze and there are ghosts in the ghost house. When this happens, the ghosts just move back and forth in the house, which is something that they should not do. This could be fixed by checking if the ghost is in the house, and if that is the case, setting the ghost's target position to be just outside of the house. 

In terms of general gameplay, pacman could be improved by adding more levels and powerups. Also, if the tunnel worked the same way that it does in the real game, where pacman moves faster in the tunnel, that would be an improvement.
