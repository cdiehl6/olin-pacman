# Things that we actually need to do #
  * Be using git properly
  * Get a sprite moving in response to arrow keys
  * Get a ghost targeting algorithm
  * Get the grid/pixel resolution (allowing for pass-through) (wait, the grid has to exist for the ghost targeting)

# Things we want #
  * movement of pacman with arrow keys
  * ghosts with correct tracking behavior
  * maps
  * powerups
  * pellets
  * music
  * some change - copyright?
